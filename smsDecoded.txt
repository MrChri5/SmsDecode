0692 | 2018/09/12 19:07:19 | ©️ | I've learned by now not to decide anything when I'm feeling like this. I think it was not telling you that made me feel worse, I just wanted to tell you how I feel.

0693 | 2018/09/12 17:53:47 | ©️ | Sounds interesting 😘 tbh I've not been great the past few days. I don't blame you, but on Sunday you were being aspie and even when you weren't gaming I felt like you were pushing me away. That along with the fact that we are still dating long distance and we haven't been able to sleep with each other in a while has gotten me feeling really depressed.

Should I tell my supervisor and try to get out of doing this project?

2075 | 2017/11/18 20:54:52 | ©️ | Rob, about earlier, there was a reason. I was having doubts, don't know if it's because we've been apart for so long or I'm just having another mood swing. I try to keep busy and not think about anything but sometimes i can't. It just makes me feel so awful.😢 
2076 | 2017/11/18 20:40:10 | ®️ | Yay, can't wait 😘😘😘😘😘

2096 | 2017/11/16 17:47:47 | ©️ | Well actually its a couple of metal parts that have come apart. Might require my dads workshop, I'm sure he can fix it when I visit at Xmas. 
2097 | 2017/11/16 17:45:49 | ®️ | Yeah, true, much more sensible approach, needle and thread 😉 
2098 | 2017/11/16 17:40:00 | ©️ | I might see if I can repair it🤔, all the surplus in my budget is going towards presents and Xmas food, and a little for a few bits for the flat. 
2099 | 2017/11/16 17:35:04 | ®️ | Not too bad thanks, sorry to hear about ur strap, but at least training went well. U can always buy a new bag for Xmas, don't cheat unself, treat unself 😘😘😘😘😘

2105 | 2017/11/15 16:10:53 | ©️ | You're welcome to come as early you like, the earlier the better. 😘😘Never made shepard's pie before but it should be easy, will have some potatoes and veg left over from Xmas dinner. 
2106 | 2017/11/15 15:38:08 | ®️ | I can come in the afternoon on the 28, say 3ish, so 29 is good 4 Xmas dinner. as for dinner ideas, maybe shepards pie. Miss you too 😘😘😘😘😘 
2107 | 2017/11/15 15:29:50 | ©️ | I was just working out the meals for Xmas so I know what to stock up on for the next month. Was thinking of doing Xmas dinner on the 29th as I'm not sure when I'll be home on the 28th, that's largely dependant on when you want to come. I need one more idea for a dinner to make, anything you'd really love me to make? 😘😘😘 
2108 | 2017/11/15 11:11:49 | ©️ | Morning 😘😘😘, hope research is going well. Miss you 😞

2120 | 2017/11/13 19:11:34 | ®️ | Aw that's cool, laid back is good, glad to c u r training is going well. ur mince pies are tasty. Washing up is not so bad, just do a little at a time 😘😘😘 
2121 | 2017/11/13 19:01:42 | ©️ | Yeah maybe and I have mince pies that I made, though I'll have to look at the ridiculous mountain of washing up I didn't do at the weekend. At least today wasn't too stressful, did day 1 of 4 of the training. It's really laid back as it's just me and the trainer and we're both internal and I already know loads about the software as I help fix bugs in it. 
2122 | 2017/11/13 18:58:30 | ®️ | Hopefully, u will feel much better once u get home and have a cup of tea 😘😘😘

My mum asked me and I couldn't help but smile at the thought of you, and then she wouldn't stop bothering me with questions😂. Anyway just got of the phone with her, apparently loads of my family ask her if I'm still single, she told some of them with mixed results.😕so that could be interesting next time i see them.

2209 | 2017/11/04 13:37:59 | ©️ | Yeah I was just looking at them, look easy enough. 
2210 | 2017/11/04 13:35:45 | ®️ | Or brandy snaps 
2211 | 2017/11/04 13:34:23 | ©️ | Cookies? I'll have a look 
2212 | 2017/11/04 13:34:11 | ©️ | Yay, I don't have to put loads of brandy in.

2227 | 2017/11/03 18:10:38 | ®️ | Christmas cake with cream icing is nice

2230 | 2017/11/03 17:27:41 | ©️ | And of course we'll be having Christmas dinner😘 
2231 | 2017/11/03 17:27:12 | ©️ | That could be a good idea, I've never made Christmas cake. I may have to sort that soon as i think the fruit needs to soak for a long time. 
2232 | 2017/11/03 17:25:35 | ®️ | With marzipan 
2233 | 2017/11/03 17:25:24 | ®️ | And I love Christmas fruit cake 
2234 | 2017/11/03 17:24:55 | ®️ | A roast with all the trimmings

2236 | 2017/11/03 17:21:26 | ©️ | Also, over the next few weeks, I'll slowly be stocking up on food and drink for Xmas.😊Is there anything you particularly want me to buy or make?😘

2238 | 2017/11/03 16:36:28 | ®️ | It depends on my supervisor 
2239 | 2017/11/03 16:36:17 | ®️ | It will be fine 😘😘😘😘maybe mid November 
2240 | 2017/11/03 16:32:32 | ©️ | Any idea when? Spending all this time apart is unbearable 😞 
2241 | 2017/11/03 16:28:10 | ®️ | Just research, lol 😘😘😘how exciting, can't wait to c the flat 
2242 | 2017/11/03 16:25:01 | ©️ | Haven't made much progress on the dump analysis I'm working on, can't really concentrate in this heat. I ordered a few more bits from Amazon as well. Planning on getting more stuff for the flat at the weekend. You got any plans?😘😘😘 
2243 | 2017/11/03 16:21:58 | ®️ | Also 😘😘😘 
2244 | 2017/11/03 16:21:42 | ®️ | Aw no, so bizarre that they havn't fixed that yet, hopefully next week will be cooler. Not too bad thanks, got loads more research to do, but getting there. How was ur day?

2249 | 2017/11/02 16:51:58 | ©️ | Not sure there's much more room on the desk 😂😂. Just finished the training at last, it was quite interesting. 
2250 | 2017/11/02 14:40:14 | ®️ | True, matching is good ☺maybe matching lamps for ur desk. 
2251 | 2017/11/02 13:40:05 | ©️ | I've already organised another side table and I'll get a lamp for the bedroom, should be here when you come at Xmas.😘😘maybe I should get two new matching lamps. I think having a table with a lamp on the far side of the sofa will make the room look smaller as it'll push the sofa up. 
2252 | 2017/11/02 13:36:44 | ®️ | Well u know my idea about having two lamps either side of ur bed, and either side of ur sofa, ambient lighting and symmetry 😝 
2253 | 2017/11/02 13:34:25 | ©️ | I'm still looking to buy more stuff for the flat, can you think of anything else it might need? 
2254 | 2017/11/02 13:27:27 | ©️ | Yeah, and the person doing the training is the same person who will do my accounting training in a few weeks, he said it's probably going to be 1 to 1. Glad to hear things are going ok.😘 
2255 | 2017/11/02 13:25:49 | ®️ | It's good ur getting to know new people 😘 
2256 | 2017/11/02 13:25:31 | ®️ | Not so bad thanks, trying to work through my historiography section. 
2257 | 2017/11/02 13:18:55 | ©️ | Training is going well so far, getting to know the other new guy, James. How's you day so far?😘😘😘 
2258 | 2017/11/02 09:28:38 | ®️ | Miss you too 😘

2263 | 2017/11/01 13:42:30 | ©️ | Don't you love that feeling when you finally have a breakthrough. Been stuck on the same dump investigation all week, finally worked out what's causing it to crash.😊

2269 | 2017/10/31 20:28:44 | ©️ | How your day been? Not too stressful i hope 😘😘 
2270 | 2017/10/31 20:23:49 | ®️ | Aw okay cool

2272 | 2017/10/31 20:20:36 | ®️ | True, maybe u can go next year when u r more comfortable 
2273 | 2017/10/31 18:26:26 | ©️ | Yeah but I just think it's going to be very awkward, and it means I'll have to commute back very late 😓

2279 | 2017/10/31 16:14:39 | ®️ | Sweet 
2280 | 2017/10/31 16:12:57 | ©️ | You know I can stand to cold, they turned it up to max this afternoon😂. Just got a text saying the lamp has been delivered to a neighbour, I'll send you a pic later.😘 
2281 | 2017/10/31 16:11:12 | ®️ | Aw no, hope you kept warm 😘 
2282 | 2017/10/31 10:53:10 | ©️ | Omg, the last stage of the heating installation is to run it on cold for a few hours. It's freezing ❄

2428 | 2017/10/19 11:22:10 | ©️ | I'm sorry if I was distant this morning, not feeling great today. It's just with you being late yesterday and worrying about not being able to contact you and us not spending much time together and thinking about how long it'll be til you next visit. I know you primarily came to visit your supervisor and catch up with your friends but I can't help feeling a little rejected and then I tend to shut down and ignore everyone.

2456 | 2017/10/16 18:21:57 | ©️ | Thought this week would be a good time to trial the route. Means we can spend more time together. 😘😘😘 
2457 | 2017/10/16 18:20:44 | ®️ | Will defo be worth it 
2458 | 2017/10/16 18:20:29 | ®️ | Aw cool, glad to hear it 
2459 | 2017/10/16 17:49:18 | ©️ | Taking a train from the office to moor street is a bit quicker despite the extra walking. I should be home at 6:30 every day this week. If i can squeeze it into my budget it will be worth it. 
2460 | 2017/10/15 20:44:29 | ®️ | Yeah, it was somewhat productive, me too, 😘😘😘 
2461 | 2017/10/15 18:29:13 | ©️ | 😘😘😘 
2462 | 2017/10/15 18:29:02 | ©️ | You had a good weekend? I can't wait for next week, miss you so much. 
2463 | 2017/10/14 20:57:17 | ®️ | Like an hour before bed, gotta get this chapter done 
2464 | 2017/10/14 20:45:10 | ©️ | Aw, don't you ever have any time to yourself when you're not researching? 
2465 | 2017/10/14 19:35:36 | ®️ | Aw cool, just researching, lol 
2466 | 2017/10/14 18:34:58 | ©️ | So, I finally got round to doing the final battle on darksiders, making a start on number 2. What you up to? 
2467 | 2017/10/13 17:17:28 | ®️ | Okay cool 
2468 | 2017/10/13 17:12:31 | ©️ | Ok, not sure when I'll be home until I've tried it on Monday. 6-7 ish hopefully 
2469 | 2017/10/13 17:11:36 | ®️ | Or maybe 6 
2470 | 2017/10/13 17:11:24 | ®️ | Probs be in Leamington around 5 
2471 | 2017/10/13 17:09:05 | ©️ | Finished for the week at last. What time are you thinking of getting here Tuesday? I'm getting two trains home all next week to see if it will work ok. 
2472 | 2017/10/13 14:41:57 | ®️ | Still researching, got lots to do 
2473 | 2017/10/13 13:43:51 | ©️ | Also I think I've sorted out my tax code with HR. What you up to? 
2474 | 2017/10/13 13:42:19 | ©️ | Well, the test server went down again 😂😂. Useless Americans 😂 
2475 | 2017/10/13 13:28:57 | ®️ | 😘😘

2478 | 2017/10/13 13:26:17 | ©️ | How are you? Still no word from the investigator? 
2479 | 2017/10/13 13:20:35 | ©️ | Yes, that's great. I can't wait 😘😘😘 
2480 | 2017/10/13 13:19:08 | ®️ | Good news, my supervisor wants to see me. I can come up next Tuesday, 17 October, and can stay at urs until Saturday, that cool? 
2481 | 2017/10/11 20:37:52 | ®️ | Everything you make is great, something with meat ☺ 
2482 | 2017/10/11 20:05:26 | ©️ | I was thinking about next week, any suggestions for dinner next weekend? 
2483 | 2017/10/11 19:53:37 | ©️ | Quite productive, and the commute wasn't too bad. Just making bolognaise at the moment. 
2484 | 2017/10/11 19:50:50 | ®️ | A little more productive, wbu? 
2485 | 2017/10/11 19:13:30 | ©️ | Hey😘, how was your day?

2488 | 2017/10/10 21:46:03 | ©️ | Thanks for earlier, It's nice to have someone there when I'm having a bad day. 😘 
2489 | 2017/10/10 20:08:56 | ®️ | Worth investigating for sure, glad u got home safe. 
2490 | 2017/10/10 20:02:29 | ©️ | Home at last, 3 hours later. Might see if I can squeeze a train ticket from Moor street to the office into my budget. 
2491 | 2017/10/10 19:14:00 | ©️ | You'll get there, I know you can 😘 
2492 | 2017/10/10 19:12:43 | ®️ | Not quite yet, still not sure, so little stressed 
2493 | 2017/10/10 19:11:20 | ©️ | Worked out if there's enough to write another chapter yet? 
2494 | 2017/10/10 19:10:25 | ®️ | Yup, still researching 
2495 | 2017/10/10 19:10:16 | ®️ | Yeah, easily fixed I guess 😉 
2496 | 2017/10/10 19:10:04 | ©️ | What are you up to at the moment? Still working? 
2497 | 2017/10/10 19:09:24 | ©️ | I am :-) . Though I really should add more music to my mp3 player, starting to repeat. 
2498 | 2017/10/10 19:07:58 | ®️ | Aw no, listen to music if u can 
2499 | 2017/10/10 18:44:51 | ©️ | Well the traffic was somehow worse today, waiting for the train, the next one is a slow train that stops at every station. :'( 
2500 | 2017/10/10 17:25:22 | ©️ | 😘😘 
2501 | 2017/10/10 17:22:50 | ®️ | ☺ 
2502 | 2017/10/10 17:22:45 | ®️ | Not really, it's all good 
2503 | 2017/10/10 17:19:30 | ©️ | Yeah can't believe it's been a year now. I didn't know if there was anything mundane you wanted to know. 
2504 | 2017/10/10 17:16:01 | ®️ | I don't have any pressing questions or concerns, we have known each other for a while now ☺ 
2505 | 2017/10/10 17:11:01 | ©️ | I've been thinking, since we won't be seeing much of each other for a few months, maybe we should get to know each other better. Is there anything you'd like to know about me? You can ask me anything. 
2506 | 2017/10/10 17:06:53 | ®️ | 😘 
2507 | 2017/10/10 16:17:29 | ©️ | Clearly it worked 😉😘 
2508 | 2017/10/10 16:16:33 | ®️ | I know 😉 
2509 | 2017/10/10 16:07:06 | ©️ | Yes, It's my favorite way to win people over and impress them. 
2510 | 2017/10/10 16:06:05 | ®️ | Aw lovely, making treats is a good way to network and make friends 
2511 | 2017/10/10 15:27:42 | ©️ | Also, the cookies went down well with the others, though I might see if I can improve the recipe when I make them for you 
2512 | 2017/10/10 15:12:18 | ©️ | Tbh, I wasn't using the test server anyway, just writing new code. And thanks. :-) 
2513 | 2017/10/10 15:09:32 | ®️ | Glad u r feeling better 
2514 | 2017/10/10 15:09:22 | ®️ | Lol, they should send u all home 
2515 | 2017/10/10 15:05:55 | ©️ | Haven't got a fever any more so that's good😊. Most of the office have been twiddling their thumbs. our main test server was down, It's based in America so we had to wait for the Americans to wake up and fix it.😂 
2516 | 2017/10/10 15:03:34 | ®️ | Just research, still not there yet 😢how are you? 
2517 | 2017/10/10 15:02:48 | ©️ | How are you?😘Been up to anything interesting? 
2518 | 2017/10/09 22:01:12 | ®️ | Aw no, sorry to hear that. Maybe tomorrow will better 
2519 | 2017/10/09 18:52:17 | ©️ | Well traffic was at a standstill this evening😡, only just got on a train, even then only because it was delayed by a few minutes.😟 
2520 | 2017/10/09 16:42:53 | ®️ | 😍😍😘😘

2527 | 2017/10/09 16:27:19 | ©️ | Also, thinking from a strictly logical point of view, ' next weekend' could refer this weekend 
2528 | 2017/10/09 16:26:57 | ®️ | Aw nice, yes please, those sound delightful 
2529 | 2017/10/09 16:23:13 | ©️ | That is a while off, but at least we have something to look forward to 😘. Would you like me to make you some pumpkin and White chocolate cookies for when you come. I'm taking to current batch into work tomorrow.

2534 | 2017/10/09 15:56:28 | ©️ | Rob, do you have any idea when you'll next be visiting. It's just that its difficult not knowing when I'll see you next. :-\ starting to feel bit lonely 
2535 | 2017/10/09 11:16:01 | ®️ | Nw 
2536 | 2017/10/09 11:12:50 | ©️ | I know it is annoying, but hopefully this means she is doing a thorough job. Sorry for the delay, was in a meeting. 
2537 | 2017/10/09 10:36:47 | ®️ | Nah not yet, just the waiting game now. 
2538 | 2017/10/09 10:32:07 | ©️ | Morning handsome 😘, still no news about the investigation? 
2539 | 2017/10/08 19:34:52 | ®️ | Same,, 😘😘😘 
2540 | 2017/10/08 19:29:58 | ©️ | I wish you were here. I miss you. 😘😘😘 
2541 | 2017/10/08 19:29:24 | ©️ | Yes, I just hope this fever breaks soon. 
2542 | 2017/10/08 19:27:57 | ®️ | Relaxing Bath is a good idea 
2543 | 2017/10/08 19:27:33 | ®️ | You can do it, onwards and upwards 
2544 | 2017/10/08 19:23:08 | ©️ | Thanks. Literally just finished it now, hope they make another series. I might see if I can stomach some dinner, then have a bath and early to bed. Work won't be much fun tomorrow. :-( 
2545 | 2017/10/08 19:18:06 | ®️ | Aw, hope you get better soon. The Expanse is amazing 
2546 | 2017/10/08 19:15:03 | ©️ | Did loads of baking, posted it on fb if you want to see. Though I've had a fever all weekend :( . Just watching the last episode of the expanse. 
2547 | 2017/10/08 19:13:02 | ®️ | Still stuck on researching, but otherwise okay, wbu? 
2548 | 2017/10/08 17:56:58 | ©️ | How was your weekend? 
2549 | 2017/10/07 19:59:39 | ®️ | Nah, still working on season 1, will let u know when I do tho 
2550 | 2017/10/07 18:58:18 | ©️ | Hey 😘, you finished watching Riverdale? Just saw season 2 is starting soon, judging by the trailer it's going to be great. 
2551 | 2017/10/06 18:02:24 | ®️ | Nw, 😊 
2552 | 2017/10/06 17:40:47 | ©️ | Don't worry, you'll get there. I guess I should stop distracting you while your researching😆. 
2553 | 2017/10/06 17:38:37 | ®️ | O, how exciting. Well done, knee u could do it. Not too bad thanks, still got lots of research to do until I am.happy that a chapter can be written 
2554 | 2017/10/06 17:31:46 | ©️ | I put the rest of my training projects into code complete status today, so all I've got left to do is the code review and then I'm finished. Already started researching my first actual project. How's your day been? 
2555 | 2017/10/06 12:45:47 | ®️ | It's great, isn't it 
2556 | 2017/10/06 12:40:35 | ©️ | I'll probably also watch more of expanse, I really like this series. 
2557 | 2017/10/06 10:53:53 | ®️ | I am sure ur takeover will b successful 
2558 | 2017/10/06 10:53:26 | ®️ | Not this weekend, maybe next 
2559 | 2017/10/06 10:28:18 | ©️ | That could be a good idea, I've almost taken over all the company shares. Though yesterday both the stock market and the global market crashed so it will be a challenge. Think you'll have time to skype over the weekend? 
2560 | 2017/10/06 10:13:59 | ®️ | Did some one say Anno marathon, lol. I miss you too 😘😘😘😘 
2561 | 2017/10/05 22:57:58 | ©️ | Haven't had a weekend alone in a while, don't know what I'll do by myself. I miss you 😘😘 
2562 | 2017/10/05 17:34:46 | ©️ | Yes, that is true. Thanks 😘 
2563 | 2017/10/05 17:30:46 | ®️ | Well at least presenting is the minority not the majority of ur job 
2564 | 2017/10/05 17:29:49 | ©️ | Yeah I guess so, but presenting is the one thing I'm awful at. The rest of my job is suited to my strengths. 
2565 | 2017/10/05 17:27:28 | ®️ | U havn't failed yet, so stay confident 
2566 | 2017/10/05 17:26:54 | ®️ | You will be great, just think how quickly you have grown 
2567 | 2017/10/05 17:15:09 | ©️ | For one of my projects I have to do a code review. Starting to feel a bit anxious about it, don't know why, it's only going to be me and my supervisor and we get on quite well. 
2568 | 2017/10/05 16:59:20 | ®️ | 😘 
2569 | 2017/10/05 16:59:15 | ®️ | Thanks Chris, really appreciate the support 
2570 | 2017/10/05 16:51:36 | ©️ | Oh dear, hopefully you won't have any more distractions, other than me. ;-) I know you can do it. 
2571 | 2017/10/05 16:45:55 | ®️ | Research, I am so far behind on work, I really need to knuckle down. 
2572 | 2017/10/05 16:42:37 | ©️ | So, you got any plans for this weekend? 
2573 | 2017/10/05 09:53:55 | ®️ | 😘😘😘😘 
2574 | 2017/10/05 09:53:26 | ©️ | Miss you more 😘 
2575 | 2017/10/05 09:52:41 | ®️ | Miss you 😘 
2576 | 2017/10/05 09:52:29 | ®️ | U will be the first to know when I do, fingers crossed, this will all be over soon 
2577 | 2017/10/05 09:51:28 | ®️ | Yeah, it was supposed to be today, but she said it may be as late as next week too 
2578 | 2017/10/05 08:18:40 | ©️ | Morning 😘. Did you say it was today that you'll know the investigator's verdict? Let me know when you do. 
2579 | 2017/10/04 14:51:16 | ®️ | Hopefully 
2580 | 2017/10/04 13:49:41 | ©️ | Yeah, at least she is giving you specifics now, which we can easily disprove. Hopefully this will all be over soon. 
2581 | 2017/10/04 13:47:58 | ®️ | Thanks Chris, this is so silly and verging on harassment 
2582 | 2017/10/04 13:47:19 | ©️ | Of course 😊 
2583 | 2017/10/04 13:46:55 | ®️ | And that I did not invite him as evidenced in the Altgay chat messages 
2584 | 2017/10/04 13:46:21 | ®️ | So can I ask the investigator to get in touch with you to confirm that zaki was not drinking, I did not behave suspiciously, and that he went home with Ramon and John o sullivan who went into Coventry 
2585 | 2017/10/04 13:44:54 | ®️ | This is so ridiculous 
2586 | 2017/10/04 13:44:30 | ®️ | Who told zaki to catch the bus 
2587 | 2017/10/04 13:44:18 | ®️ | Alex ashley 
2588 | 2017/10/04 13:41:59 | ©️ | Yes. And Yes I read it. Can't make out, who is that over Dan's shoulder? 
2589 | 2017/10/04 13:40:56 | ®️ | Did u read the email 
2590 | 2017/10/04 13:38:41 | ®️ | Lol, so worth it 
2591 | 2017/10/04 13:37:47 | ©️ | Yeah, just as well I'm on contact now, or our long distance relationship could be very expensive 
2592 | 2017/10/04 13:36:28 | ®️ | Let's text it's easier 
2593 | 2017/10/04 13:30:51 | ®️ | I will send it to u on fb 
2594 | 2017/10/04 13:30:09 | ©️ | Yeah sure. 
2595 | 2017/10/04 13:29:47 | ®️ | I did not invite him, and he wasn't drinking 
2596 | 2017/10/04 13:29:14 | ®️ | I will ask the investigator to get in touch with u to confirm this 
2597 | 2017/10/04 13:28:52 | ©️ | Though I can't read much of it, It's to pixilated 
2598 | 2017/10/04 13:28:12 | ©️ | Good idea, disprove this lie and she should see that the rest is also false. 
2599 | 2017/10/04 13:27:23 | ®️ | I am going to send her this 
2600 | 2017/10/04 13:27:13 | ®️ | And I didn't invite him 
2601 | 2017/10/04 13:27:02 | ®️ | Do u remember, he wasn't drinking 
2602 | 2017/10/04 13:26:39 | ©️ | Well I was there that time. That's ridiculous. 
2603 | 2017/10/04 13:25:21 | ®️ | For Christmas 
2604 | 2017/10/04 13:25:10 | ®️ | Chris, Scott and the others are now accusing me of having brought Zaki to Varsity that one time that we all met up 
2605 | 2017/10/03 14:19:23 | ®️ | Same 😘😘😘😘😘 
2606 | 2017/10/03 12:58:54 | ©️ | 😘😘miss you😘😘 
2607 | 2017/10/03 12:57:04 | ®️ | Nah, not yet, but u will be the first to know when I do 😘 
2608 | 2017/10/03 12:54:29 | ©️ | Any idea when you'll be coming😉to visit 
2609 | 2017/10/03 12:37:42 | ®️ | I really hope so 
2610 | 2017/10/03 12:37:06 | ©️ | That's great 😁😁, this should tip the scales in your favour. 
2611 | 2017/10/03 12:33:45 | ®️ | I will send her replies to the lead investigator 
2612 | 2017/10/03 12:33:28 | ®️ | She has just got back to me and says she has never seen me pour alcohol into other peoples drinks, or behave suspiciously when other people are drunk. 
2613 | 2017/10/03 12:27:29 | ©️ | I know it can take a while to settle. Still not heard anything back from the bar tender? 
2614 | 2017/10/03 12:25:54 | ®️ | Hurray, this is great news 😀so glad to hear this. Yeah, nearly unpacked. Will take a while to settle in. 
2615 | 2017/10/03 12:14:16 | ©️ | Wasn't having a great day til now. Just found the last pay check I got had an 'emergency month 1' tax code. Meaning I paid tax on all my earnings not just those above the personal allowance. Basically it means I will be getting £200 per month more than i thought. So I'm not as screwed as i first thought ☺. How are things with you, unpacked yet? 
2616 | 2017/10/02 20:21:54 | ®️ | Aw cool, sounds like a plan ☺ 
2617 | 2017/10/02 18:33:22 | ©️ | Wish I could, but I had one yesterday and I'm trying to keep the bills down. I might have a drink instead and watch more of expanse. 
2618 | 2017/10/02 18:30:52 | ®️ | Nw, lol, have a nice hot bath.  
2619 | 2017/10/02 18:04:13 | ©️ | Sorry, that last text may have been a bit grumpy, It's been a long day and I'm stressed. 😟 Miss you😘😘 
2620 | 2017/10/02 17:09:33 | ©️ | You should do what I do and unpack it all in a day or two. Better to get it out of the way. Not sure why you're complaining about writing, surely you've had plenty of practice by now. I always get so anxious before I send an email or text.

2705 | 2017/09/24 12:24:37 | ©️ | On my way home buy of my trains was cancelled. The weekend was great 🙂I lounged in my dads hot tub and played around with his new 3D printer. Meeting up with my old school mates was great we just sat around and talked about old times until about 3 in the morning, and we weren't even drinking. Don't think I've laughed so much in ages, my diaphragm aches now 😂. 
2706 | 2017/09/24 12:16:55 | ®️ | How was ur weekend at home? 
2707 | 2017/09/24 12:13:56 | ®️ | Thank you Chris, I forgive you and miss u sooo much 😘I couldn't imagine going through this ordeal without u 😊I now have five supporting emails that will be sent before Tuesday's meeting, and will get more next week. So things are looking good. 
2708 | 2017/09/24 08:46:57 | ©️ | Good morning, I forgive you 😙. and I'm sorry for nosing around your fb profile. How's the investigation going? I miss you 😘 
2709 | 2017/09/22 23:31:05 | ®️ | I completely understand and appreciate that, I know that u will also need space and time. I am sorry Chris, I hope in time I can regain ur trust. 
2710 | 2017/09/22 23:28:14 | ©️ | Look, while i understand why you did, it doesn't mean I'm not a little hurt by the fact that you lied. 
2711 | 2017/09/22 23:09:15 | ®️ | Hope ur weekend goes well at home, I will miss u 😓

2718 | 2017/09/22 22:54:06 | ®️ | I know right, and in the gay world 30 is like a death sentence 😢 
2719 | 2017/09/22 22:51:17 | ©️ | It's ok, I probably would have done the same.😕I know everyone makes a big deal of age milestones. 
2720 | 2017/09/22 22:48:08 | ®️ | 😓😓😓😓 
2721 | 2017/09/22 22:43:49 | ®️ | R u cross with me 
2722 | 2017/09/22 22:41:49 | ®️ | Soz, I know it sounds silly, but I just didn't want to tell u I was 30 😢, I thought u would like me less, silly I know, I am sorry 
2723 | 2017/09/22 22:30:49 | ©️ | You left yourself logged into Facebook and I'll admit I might have taken a peak at your profile before logging off 😕. It says you were born in '87, you told me you are only 29. . . 
2724 | 2017/09/22 21:27:28 | ®️ | Hopefully 
2725 | 2017/09/22 21:10:41 | ©️ | That's great, hopefully this will all be over soon

2728 | 2017/09/22 21:08:36 | ®️ | Thanks 
2729 | 2017/09/22 21:08:33 | ®️ | Okay cool 
2730 | 2017/09/22 21:03:20 | ©️ | Just open it in a web browser, then ctrl+F to open the find bar 
2731 | 2017/09/22 21:02:18 | ®️ | Chris how do I word search through my fb data once I've got it, like u did last night? 
2732 | 2017/09/22 19:47:21 | ®️ | Will do 
2733 | 2017/09/22 19:47:14 | ®️ | My pleasure, least I could do. 
2734 | 2017/09/22 19:41:27 | ©️ | And can you send me that email address 
2735 | 2017/09/22 19:30:22 | ©️ | Just got home, thanks for washing up 😊 
2736 | 2017/09/22 17:04:23 | ®️ | Thanks Chris, greatly appreciated 
2737 | 2017/09/22 16:57:47 | ©️ | I'll message her on my way home 
2738 | 2017/09/22 16:55:47 | ®️ | Lol, true, I like spending time at urs tho. Another one of my friends has agreed to write a supporting email, so feel good. Could you please ask ur friend who works at Terrace about the name of the girl who works there, short in height and of African descent (I think her name is like Addawa). Just say u want to know as she is always very nice to one of ur friends (which is true she is always very nice to me) who wants to thank her. 
2739 | 2017/09/22 16:11:08 | ©️ | Glad to hear you got back ok. You must feel like a stranger in your flat after spending so much time at mine. 😂 
2740 | 2017/09/22 15:59:31 | ®️ | Thanks Chris, much appreciated. I just got back to my flat 
2741 | 2017/09/22 15:27:56 | ©️ | Ok, I've made those changes to the email, ready to be sent later. 
2742 | 2017/09/22 13:25:51 | ®️ | Thanks again Chris, much appreciated 
2743 | 2017/09/22 13:25:35 | ®️ | Cool, will send it later tonight, once u have amended the e-mail. 
2744 | 2017/09/22 13:18:13 | ©️ | You picked up on all the bits i had trouble phrasing while I was still half asleep this morning😆. I'll send it when I get home tonight, I just need her email address. 
2745 | 2017/09/22 13:13:10 | ®️ | For the second to last paragraph on the second screenshot you may want to say ' these accusations so as to (isolate) Rob (from the group)". Otherwise, looks good 
2746 | 2017/09/22 13:06:22 | ®️ | In the second paragraph on the second screenshot, I suggest 'Rob has in the past spoken out against the suspicious acts of other people in our community ' i suggest deleting 'including that which he himself is being accused of' as you don't want to be too specific without providing substantial evidence. 
2747 | 2017/09/22 12:48:32 | ®️ | For the last line of the last paragraph on the first screenshot you could write 'as he (is) someone who people (have trusted and turned to) when they have a problem. 
2748 | 2017/09/22 12:39:23 | ®️ | Thanks for sending over the letter it looks good, just a few tiny suggestions. 
2749 | 2017/09/22 12:38:01 | ®️ | Thanks, they have been great 😊I am just having breakfast at urs now. I wish I could stay, but I need to get back to mine this afternoon and sort out stuff. You know ILY too 😘. 
2750 | 2017/09/22 08:07:32 | ©️ | Thanks for an amazing couple of days. I wish I could come back later and find you still there. ILY 😘 
2751 | 2017/09/21 18:04:30 | ®️ | Cool 
2752 | 2017/09/21 17:57:42 | ©️ | Ran onto the platform just in time to see the 17:55 train driving off into the distance. ☹I'll be home at 7
