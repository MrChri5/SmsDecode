I wish I could come back later and find you still there. ILY 😘 ®️: Thanks, they have been great 😊I am just having breakfast at urs now. I wish I could stay, but I need to get back to mine this afternoon and sort out stuff. You know ILY too 😘. ®️: Thanks for sending over the letter it looks good, just a few tiny suggestions. ®️: For the last line of the last paragraph on the first screenshot you could write 'as he (is) someone who people (have trusted and turned to) when they have a problem. ®️: In the second paragraph on the second screenshot, I suggest 'Rob has in the past spoken out against the suspicious acts of other people in our community ' i suggest deleting 'including that which he himself is being accused of' as you don't want to be too specific without providing substantial evidence. ®️: For the second to last paragraph on the second screenshot you may want to say ' these accusations so as to (isolate) Rob (from the group)". Otherwise, looks good ©️: You picked up on all the bits i had trouble phrasing while I was still half asleep this morning😆. I'll send it when I get home tonight, I just need her email address. ®️: Cool, will send it later tonight, once u have amended the e-mail. ®️: Thanks again Chris, much appreciated ©️: Ok, I've made those changes to the email, ready to be sent later. ®️: Thanks Chris, much appreciated. I just got back to my flat ©️: Glad to hear you got back ok. You must feel like a stranger in your flat after spending so much time at mine. 😂 ®️: Lol, true, I like spending time at urs tho. Another one of my friends has agreed to write a supporting email, so feel good. Could you please ask ur friend who works at Terrace about the name of the girl who works there, short in height and of African descent (I think her name is like Addawa). Just say u want to know as she is always very nice to one of ur friends (which is true she is always very nice to me) who wants to thank her. ©️: I'll message her on my way home ®️: Thanks Chris, greatly appreciated ©️: Just got home, thanks for washing up 😊 ©️: And can you send me that email address ®️: My pleasure, least I could do. ®️: Will do ®️: Chris how do I word search through my fb data once I've got it, like u did last night? ©️: Just open it in a web browser, then ctrl+F to open the find bar ®️: Okay cool ®️: Thanks ®️: Two more of my friends have agreed to write supporting e-mails ®️: So that is good ©️: That's great, hopefully this will all be over soon ®️: Hopefully ©️: You left yourself logged into Facebook and I'll admit I might have taken a peak at your profile before logging off 😕. It says you were born in '87, you told me you are only 29. . . ®️: Soz, I know it sounds silly, but I just didn't want to tell u I was 30 😢, I thought u would like me less, silly I know, I am sorry ®️: R u cross with me ®️: 😓😓😓😓 ©️: It's ok, I probably would have done the same.😕I know everyone makes a big deal of age milestones. ®️: I know right, and in the gay world 30 is like a death sentence 😢 ©️: Still not really in a mood to talk ©️: And I'm busy baking jam tarts ®️: Is ur phone working, I tried to call u ®️: I kinda miss spending evenings with u, my flat seems really empty 😢 ®️: Fair enough ®️: Fair enough ®️: Hope ur weekend goes well at home, I will miss u 😓 ©️: Look, while i understand why you did, it doesn't mean I'm not a little hurt by the fact that you lied. ®️: I completely understand and appreciate that, I know that u will also need space and time. I am sorry Chris, I hope in time I can regain ur trust. ©️: Good morning, I forgive you 😙. and I'm sorry for nosing around your fb profile. How's the investigation going? I miss you 😘 ®️: Thank you Chris, I forgive you and miss u sooo much 😘I couldn't imagine going through this ordeal without u 😊I now have five supporting emails that will be sent before Tuesday's meeting, and will get more next week. So things are looking good. ®️: How was ur weekend at home? ©️: On my way home buy of my trains was cancelled. The weekend was great 🙂I lounged in my dads hot tub and played around with his new 3D printer. Meeting up with my old school mates was great we just sat around and talked about old times until about 3 in the morning, and we weren't even drinking. Don't think I've laughed so much in ages, my diaphragm aches now 😂. ®️: Aw, so glad to hear that. A nice mini holiday. ©️: Yes it was nice, also got to see my parents and Jake. I'm home now at last.

Maybe bring one with you, unless you planning on doing something tomorrow 😂 ©️: Yes of course I can come to yours on Friday. You're still coming round tonight right?? Miss you too 😘 ©️: And I wasn't joking when i said you could stay with me if you left RLT. You are always welcome at my flat. 😊 ®️: Could you please come here tonight, I am just super stressed and kinda not able to leave my flat, feeling unable to face the outside world. ®️: And thanks Chris, appreciate the offer. For now I need to just spend some time with family away from Warwick ©️: Ok, I'll come to you. I should be able to get to you for 8.

You said you were depressed, please tell me you haven't been feeling suicidal. 😰 ®️: No nothing like that, just packing is getting me down, dw ©️: Phew, I've been there. And I'm already worrying a bit about my brother. I couldn't bare to think of you going through that. ®️: Dw, just stressed, that's all. ©️: Just thinking, do you have anything I could have for dinner or shall I quickly grab a snack at home. ®️: Quickly grab a snack at home ®️: I have hardly anything ®️: Also did ur friend get back to u about the name of that bar tenderess? ©️: Ok, will do. I did ask her, but she couldn't find who you were looking for. ®️: Aw no, maybe she doesn't work there anymore ®️: Forgot to say my friend from London is here with me now, but he will be leaving at 9.30 ☺, he came to help me pack ®️: My friends are so cool ®️: Bfs are cooler tho 😉 ©️: Thanks ☺, I managed to get the early train so I should get to you quicker, packed like sardines tho.

Found out I won't be the noob at work for much longer. Our team is getting a new addition next week. ®️: Aw cool, that will be nice. Not too bad thanks, just got lots to unpack now. I have safely moved though which is good. Got lots of emails to write 😢 ©️: You should do what I do and unpack it all in a day or two. Better to get it out of the way. Not sure why you're complaining about writing, surely you've had plenty of practice by now. I always get so anxious before I send an email or text. ©️: Sorry, that last text may have been a bit grumpy, It's been a long day and I'm stressed. 😟 Miss you😘😘 ®️: Nw, lol, have a nice hot bath.  ©️: Wish I could, but I had one yesterday and I'm trying to keep the bills down. I might have a drink instead and watch more of expanse. ®️: Aw cool, sounds like a plan ☺ ©️: Wasn't having a great day til now. Just found the last pay check I got had an 'emergency month 1' tax code. Meaning I paid tax on all my earnings not just those above the personal allowance. Basically it means I will be getting £200 per month more than i thought. So I'm not as screwed as i first thought ☺. How are things with you, unpacked yet? ®️: Hurray, this is great news 😀so glad to hear this. Yeah, nearly unpacked. Will take a while to settle in. ©️: I know it can take a while to settle. Still not heard anything back from the bar tender? ®️: She has just got back to me and says she has never seen me pour alcohol into other peoples drinks, or behave suspiciously when other people are drunk. ®️: I will send her replies to the lead investigator ©️: That's great 😁😁, this should tip the scales in your favour. ®️: I really hope so ©️: Any idea when you'll be coming😉to visit ®️: Nah, not yet, but u will be the first to know when I do 😘 ©️: 😘😘miss you😘😘 ®️: Same 😘😘😘😘😘 ®️: Chris, Scott and the others are now accusing me of having brought Zaki to Varsity that one time that we all met up ®️: For Christmas ©️: Well I was there that time. That's ridiculous. ®️: Do u remember, he wasn't drinking ®️: And I didn't invite him ®️: I am going to send her this ©️: Good idea, disprove this lie and she should see that the rest is also false. ©️: Though I can't read much of it, It's to pixilated ®️: I will ask the investigator to get in touch with u to confirm this ®️: I did not invite him, and he wasn't drinking ©️: Yeah sure. ®️: I will send it to u on fb ®️: Let's text it's easier ©️: Yeah, just as well I'm on contact now, or our long distance relationship could be very expensive ®️: Lol, so worth it ®️: Did u read the email ©️: Yes. And Yes I read it. Can't make out, who is that over Dan's shoulder? ®️: Alex ashley ®️: Who told zaki to catch the bus ®️: This is so ridiculous ®️: So can I ask the investigator to get in touch with you to confirm that zaki was not drinking, I did not behave suspiciously, and that he went home with Ramon and John o sullivan who went into Coventry ®️: And that I did not invite him as evidenced in the Altgay chat messages ©️: Of course 😊 ®️: Thanks Chris, this is so silly and verging on harassment ©️: Yeah, at least she is giving you specifics now, which we can easily disprove. Hopefully this will all be over soon. ®️: Hopefully ©️: Morning 😘. Did you say it was today that you'll know the investigator's verdict? Let me know when you do. ®️: Yeah, it was supposed to be today, but she said it may be as late as next week too ®️: U will be the first to know when I do, fingers crossed, this will all be over soon ®️: Miss you 😘 ©️: Miss you more 😘 ®️: 😘😘😘😘 ©️: So, you got any plans for this weekend? ®️: Research, I am so far behind on work, I really need to knuckle down. ©️: Oh dear, hopefully you won't have any more distractions, other than me. ;-) I know you can do it. ®️: Thanks Chris, really appreciate the support ®️: 😘 ©️: For one of my projects I have to do a code review. Starting to feel a bit anxious about it, don't know why, it's only going to be me and my supervisor and we get on quite well. ®️: You will be great, just think how quickly you have grown ®️: U havn't failed yet, so stay confident ©️: Yeah I guess so, but presenting is the one thing I'm awful at. The rest of my job is suited to my strengths. ®️: Well at least presenting is the minority not the majority of ur job ©️: Yes, that is true. Thanks 😘 ©️: Haven't had a weekend alone in a while, don't know what I'll do by myself. I miss you 😘😘 ®️: Did some one say Anno marathon, lol. I miss you too 😘😘😘😘 ©️: That could be a good idea, I've almost taken over all the company shares. Though yesterday both the stock market and the global market crashed so it will be a challenge. Think you'll have time to skype over the weekend? ®️: Not this weekend, maybe next ®️: I am sure ur takeover will b successful ©️: I'll probably also watch more of expanse, I really like this series. ®️: It's great, isn't it ©️: I put the rest of my training projects into code complete status today, so all I've got left to do is the code review and then I'm finished. Already started researching my first actual project. How's your day been? ®️: O, how exciting. Well done, knee u could do it. Not too bad thanks, still got lots of research to do until I am.happy that a chapter can be written ©️: Don't worry, you'll get there. I guess I should stop distracting you while your researching😆. ®️: Nw, 😊 ©️: Hey 😘, you finished watching Riverdale? Just saw season 2 is starting soon, judging by the trailer it's going to be great. ®️: Nah, still working on season 1, will let u know when I do tho ©️: How was your weekend? ®️: Still stuck on researching, but otherwise okay, wbu? ©️: Did loads of baking, posted it on fb if you want to see. Though I've had a fever all weekend :( . Just watching the last episode of the expanse. ®️: Aw, hope you get better soon. The Expanse is amazing ©️: Thanks. Literally just finished it now, hope they make another series. I might see if I can stomach some dinner, then have a bath and early to bed. Work won't be much fun tomorrow. :-( ®️: You can do it, onwards and upwards ®️: Relaxing Bath is a good idea ©️: Yes, I just hope this fever breaks soon. ©️: I wish you were here. I miss you. 😘😘😘 ®️: Same,, 😘😘😘 ©️: Morning handsome 😘, still no news about the investigation? ®️: Nah not yet, just the waiting game now. ©️: I know it is annoying, but hopefully this means she is doing a thorough job. Sorry for the delay, was in a meeting. ®️: Nw ©️: Rob, do you have any idea when you'll next be visiting. It's just that its difficult not knowing when I'll see you next. :-\ starting to feel bit lonely ®️: I am thinking next weekend ®️: U will never be lonely, being single is lonely ☺ ©️: ☺do you mean this weekend or the one after ®️: Next weekend ☺ ©️: That is a while off, but at least we have something to look forward to 😘. Would you like me to make you some pumpkin and White chocolate cookies for when you come. I'm taking to current batch into work tomorrow. ®️: Aw nice, yes please, those sound delightful ©️: Also, thinking from a strictly logical point of view, ' next weekend' could refer this weekend ®️: Next next weekend lol ®️: Good point tho, I will use dates next time. Mind is all over the place atm ®️: Kiss and miss u too 😘 ©️: 😘😘😘😘😘 ©️: Love You ❤ ®️: Same ®️: 😍😍😘😘 ©️: Well traffic was at a standstill this evening😡, only just got on a train, even then only because it was delayed by a few minutes.😟 ®️: Aw no, sorry to hear that. Maybe tomorrow will better ©️: How are you?😘Been up to anything interesting? ®️: Just research, still not there yet 😢how are you? ©️: Haven't got a fever any more so that's good😊. Most of the office have been twiddling their thumbs. our main test server was down, It's based in America so we had to wait for the Americans to wake up and fix it.😂 ®️: Lol, they should send u all home ®️: Glad u r feeling better ©️: Tbh, I wasn't using the test server anyway, just writing new code. And thanks. :-) ©️: Also, the cookies went down well with the others, though I might see if I can improve the recipe when I make them for you ®️: Aw lovely, making treats is a good way to network and make friends ©️: Yes, It's my favorite way to win people over and impress them. ®️: I know 😉 ©️: Clearly it worked 😉😘 ®️: 😘 ©️: I've been thinking, since we won't be seeing much of each other for a few months, maybe we should get to know each other better. Is there anything you'd like to know about me? You can ask me anything. ®️: I don't have any pressing questions or concerns, we have known each other for a while now ☺ ©️: Yeah can't believe it's been a year now. I didn't know if there was anything mundane you wanted to know. ®️: Not really, it's all good ®️: ☺ ©️: 😘😘 ©️: Well the traffic was somehow worse today, waiting for the train, the next one is a slow train that stops at every station. :'( ®️: Aw no, listen to music if u can ©️: I am :-) . Though I really should add more music to my mp3 player, starting to repeat. ©️: What are you up to at the moment? Still working? ®️: Yeah, easily fixed I guess 😉 ®️: Yup, still researching ©️: Worked out if there's enough to write another chapter yet? ®️: Not quite yet, still not sure, so little stressed ©️: You'll get there, I know you can 😘 ©️: Home at last, 3 hours later.

I should be home at 6:30 every day this week. If i can squeeze it into my budget it will be worth it. ®️: Aw cool, glad to hear it ®️: Will defo be worth it ©️: Thought this week would be a good time to trial the route.

Need a bath. ©️: The might be done in the tall cupboard by the pull up bar. Though I think the only proper towel I have is my blue one, which you're welcome to use. Also you will want to let the water heat for a while, like at least half an hour. ®️: Aw okay cool, will do, thanks 😘 ©️: Did you have a relaxing bath? Don't forget to turn the water off 😘 ®️: Yes thanks was great ®️: Dw, I know 😘 ©️: Not sure I'll get much work done today😂, can't stop thinking about you. 😘😘😘 ®️: Aw 😘😘😘😘 ®️: I am trying very hard to work ®️: Btw, do u have a hair dryer? ©️: Yeah, under your side of the bed, near where my shaver is charging. ®️: Ah cool, where did u say the iron was again 😂 ©️: In the tall cupboard by the pull up bar, middle self.

It's just with you being late yesterday and worrying about not being able to contact you and us not spending much time together and thinking about how long it'll be til you next visit. I know you primarily came to visit your supervisor and catch up with your friends but I can't help feeling a little rejected and then I tend to shut down and ignore everyone. ®️: No need to apologise, I know it has been a bit hectic, and I am sorry for that, dw though, you are not rejected, but loved 😘😘😘I wil try to get dinner over and done with as quickly as possible. In other news, a fire alarm went off in my department, everyone is standing in the rain 😓 ©️: Oh dear, hope you didn't get to wet and that the meeting went well.

Help yourself to the Chicken if you like ©️: Flat 15 ashlawn house CV31 1HQ ©️: As you mentioned it earlier, clearly you remembered I liked the idea of fluffy handcuffs. I might get some when I'm paid, it should be fun. Do you have any fantasies, anything you want to do to me?😘 ®️: Can Hugo bring His bf tonight? ®️: Let me think about it ®️: 😘😘😘😘 ©️: Sure thing, the more the merrier. ®️: Cool ©️: I'm not being given any more tasks until I've done this code review so I can prepare.

Done much today? ®️: Trying to research, havn't found anything yet ©️: Have you spent all day in bed like you wanted to?😊 ®️: Nah, been researching ©️: Didn't know if you were set up with your laptop in bed, I know how much you love my bed. ;-) ®️: 😘😘 ®️: Let me know when you are on ur way, and if u can't get in ©️: I should be home at half past.

Saw they have a market there every Sunday. Maybe next time you visit we could go there, could be a good place to do some Christmas shopping. ®️: Ah sweet, sounds good.

Have you had any thoughts about what you want for Xmas? ®️: Not really, maybe we could buy each other slippers ©️: Could do, but I thought you wanted to get matching ones😘. Don't worry there's still loads of time til Xmas for you to think, I was just in a Christmassy mood after going shopping. ®️: Yeah, we have loads of time 😘😘😘 ©️: Well that's the code review out of the way, it went great☺, probably the first time I've done something like that and not been anxious. How are you?😘 ®️: Aw hurray, well done, okay, just researching, no major discoveries yet 😘 ©️: Lol, that's pretty much what the rest of my day has been, researching for the new project I was given. Some of the files are very complicated and a mess, I found one which was first written in 1981. ©️: Also I rearranged the bedroom last night so there will be room for another bedside table😘, need to find a space for the laundry bag. ®️: Aw how exciting, can't wait to see it 😘😘 ©️: Well I still need to buy the table, hopefully before Xmas.

Spending so much time apart is difficult and I miss you 😘 ®️: Sure, we can Skype during ur lunch hour on Wednesday 😘 ©️: Can't really skype at work😕, the programming floor has to be quiet. In the evening might be better.😘 ®️: Also can cum and c u from 28 December to 3 January😘 ®️: Evenings not great for me, as often the family have dinner and then I wash up, and do other chores, but can try ©️: 28th is great 😘 just organising Xmas with the family now ®️: Great 😘 ©️: Ok, so that's Xmas plans sorted.

It's freezing ❄ ®️: Aw no, hope you kept warm 😘 ©️: You know I can stand to cold, they turned it up to max this afternoon😂. Just got a text saying the lamp has been delivered to a neighbour, I'll send you a pic later.😘 ®️: Sweet ©️: Is it bad of me to not go to the work Xmas meal?😕 ®️: Um, it depends how well u know the people, might be fun, I know it can be an anxious though ®️: An anxious thing ©️: I only know a few of them, and I can't really drink loads since my boss is going to be there. ®️: Just be yourself, you will be great, talk to tye people you know, be open to meeting others 😘 ©️: Yeah but I just think it's going to be very awkward, and it means I'll have to commute back very late 😓 ®️: True, maybe u can go next year when u r more comfortable ©️: There is a BBQ in the summer for everyone and their families so we could go to that together, I should know people a bit better by then. ®️: Aw okay cool ©️: How your day been? Not too stressful i hope 😘😘 ®️: Not too bad, it's hard getting thus chapter done. ©️: You can do it 😘and it'll be worth it once It's finished ®️: Thanks 😘hopefully it will all get done ☺ ©️: Morning sexy 😘😘😘missing you so much 😍 ®️: Same 😘😘😘😘 ©️: Don't you love that feeling when you finally have a breakthrough.

How's you day so far?😘😘😘 ®️: Not so bad thanks, trying to work through my historiography section. ®️: It's good ur getting to know new people 😘 ©️: Yeah, and the person doing the training is the same person who will do my accounting training in a few weeks, he said it's probably going to be 1 to 1. Glad to hear things are going ok.😘 ©️: I'm still looking to buy more stuff for the flat, can you think of anything else it might need? ®️: Well u know my idea about having two lamps either side of ur bed, and either side of ur sofa, ambient lighting and symmetry 😝 ©️: I've already organised another side table and I'll get a lamp for the bedroom, should be here when you come at Xmas.😘😘maybe I should get two new matching lamps. I think having a table with a lamp on the far side of the sofa will make the room look smaller as it'll push the sofa up. ®️: True, matching is good ☺maybe matching lamps for ur desk. ©️: Not sure there's much more room on the desk 😂😂. Just finished the training at last, it was quite interesting. ©️: I miss you 😘😘😘Any idea when this month you can visit? ®️: Not sure yet, will let u know as soon as I do ☺ ®️: Miss you too 😘😘😘 ©️: Hey bf 😘😘. How's your day been? They still haven't got the right temperature in the office, I'm so hot. 😓 ®️: Aw no, so bizarre that they havn't fixed that yet, hopefully next week will be cooler. Not too bad thanks, got loads more research to do, but getting there. How was ur day? ®️: Also 😘😘😘 ©️: Haven't made much progress on the dump analysis I'm working on, can't really concentrate in this heat. I ordered a few more bits from Amazon as well. Planning on getting more stuff for the flat at the weekend. You got any plans?😘😘😘 ®️: Just research, lol 😘😘😘how exciting, can't wait to c the flat ©️: Any idea when? Spending all this time apart is unbearable 😞 ®️: It will be fine 😘😘😘😘maybe mid November ®️: It depends on my supervisor ©️: I know you can't be here much, you'd never get any work done .😂I miss waking up next to you😘😘 ©️: Also, over the next few weeks, I'll slowly be stocking up on food and drink for Xmas.😊Is there anything you particularly want me to buy or make?😘 ®️: Aw how exciting, I love Christmas, and ur cooking ®️: A roast with all the trimmings ®️: And I love Christmas fruit cake ®️: With marzipan ©️: That could be a good idea, I've never made Christmas cake. I may have to sort that soon as i think the fruit needs to soak for a long time. ©️: And of course we'll be having Christmas dinner😘 ©️: I'll also make mince pies and probably stollen. Any bits you'd like me to buy? ®️: We can always go shopping together on the 28 ®️: Christmas cake with cream icing is nice ®️: Mince pies are awesome ©️: I was thinking of doing most of the shopping the friday before, but we can go together as well, just thought it might be busy. ®️: Aha, okay, good point ®️: Tbf, anything u make will be delicious 😘 ©️: Thanks😘😘 ©️: I haven't been excited for Xmas in a very long time. I'm so glad I have you to spend this Xmas with, It's going to be great. ©️: Love you 😘 ®️: Ikr, will be amazing 😘😘😘 ©️: I've got loads of fruit soaking in brandy for the cake.

My mum asked me and I couldn't help but smile at the thought of you, and then she wouldn't stop bothering me with questions😂. Anyway just got of the phone with her, apparently loads of my family ask her if I'm still single, she told some of them with mixed results.😕so that could be interesting next time i see them. ©️: But I'm ok, just busy in the kitchen. How about you?😘😘 ©️: Hey😘😘, you ok? ®️: Yeah, soz, been having dinner. Well family can be weird about stuff like that, so best see how it goes.

Day has been slow, found some stuff about gallows speeches, but nothing about urban fires 😓maybe u could watch stranger things s2, that would be a good distraction ☺ ®️: Miss you 😘😘😘😘😘 ©️: I haven't made a start on that yet, there's loads of things that I'm watching that are being broadcast weekly, hopefully there's something new to watch tonight. Just got on the train 😢and tbh i don't think ever standing on a train platform has been that bad😓. Sorry to hear research is slow, I'm sure it will get better 😘. ®️: Hopefully, u will feel much better once u get home and have a cup of tea 😘😘😘 ©️: Yeah maybe and I have mince pies that I made, though I'll have to look at the ridiculous mountain of washing up I didn't do at the weekend. At least today wasn't too stressful, did day 1 of 4 of the training. It's really laid back as it's just me and the trainer and we're both internal and I already know loads about the software as I help fix bugs in it. ®️: Aw that's cool, laid back is good, glad to c u r training is going well. ur mince pies are tasty. Washing up is not so bad, just do a little at a time 😘😘😘 ©️: Miss you 😘 ©️: Thanks for yesterday😘, you always make me feel so much better. Your support means the world to me.

Can't stop thinking of you, you make me so 😈. Wish you were here 😘😘😍 ®️: Same 😘😘😘😘not too bad, still need to do way more work 😢 ©️: Morning 😘😘😘, hope research is going well. Miss you 😞 ©️: I was just working out the meals for Xmas so I know what to stock up on for the next month. Was thinking of doing Xmas dinner on the 29th as I'm not sure when I'll be home on the 28th, that's largely dependant on when you want to come.
